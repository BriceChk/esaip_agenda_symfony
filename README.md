# ESAIP Agenda (API)

This is the API for the [ESAIP Agenda app](https://github.com/BriceChk/esaip_agenda_flutter).

This is for a school project at ESAIP Engineering School (FR). It connects to Alcuin (the school's timetable & grades platform) and allows students to save notes and view their classes and grades.
